Till Lindemann, a member of the Rammstein music group has a side project called Lindemann, which he founded in collaboration with Peter Tägtgren. Steh Auf is one of the most successful tracks on the band’s F&M album in 2019. The song has a striking clip. Steh Auf means wake up. Although the lyrics of the song are written as the son of a drug-addicted mother calling out to her, the song in contrast extremely lively for the listener. The director of the clip, Zoran Bihać, used a different image for the clip.

In Lindemann's Steh Auf, clip looks like it has been taken from a dream sequence. As the audience, we see this whole situation through the eyes of the lethargic and blocked. Wake up! The sleep, the state of heedlessness that the song cries out, is described as a psychological blur. The grotesque appearances of actors Peter Stormare and Till Lindemann make it difficult for the audience to empathize, while their shabby, unimportant situation creates a tragicomic atmosphere. When an Asian woman on a horse breaks down the wall and kidnaps Lindemann after drug use and mental problems, it makes the story funnier and even more dramatic by ending the suffering of the character in an alienated way. Reminiscent of China, in tune with the danger from the east, the attack of three white men by an Asian woman blends concerning the spirit of our time.

### Conqueror of the Steps

The part of the clip where the horsemen came was shot on the steppes of Kazakhstan. Here, anachronism acts as a method of art. The image that comes to our eyes, it can be interpreted as a reference to the Mongolian invasion, actually describes one of the painful scenes of humanity. While Genghis Khan, who was born in 1162, changed the carbon footprint of humanity on the planet with the 60 million people he had killed, reduced word population 11% at that time as a result of the Mongol raids. It is not known whether it has affected our social subconscious - if there is such a thing - but the figures show that today it is possible to talk about a trace of the Mongolian invasion period, in terms of human history, in which 16 million people around the world are considered to be 0.5%, direct descendants. The director of the clip finds this image intuitively. The distant remainder of a Mongolian rider on an open field - this great trauma of history - becomes the refreshing solution that the flow of life has founded to bring end to the unfunctional, the blocked.
